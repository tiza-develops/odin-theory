> To keep fonts reactive to the display size
> To respect user preferences
2. What are some instances where you might want to use vh and vw?
> These can be useful any time you want something to be sized relative to the viewport, examples including full-height heroes, full-screen app-like interfaces
3. What are some instances where you might want to use px instead of a relative unit?
