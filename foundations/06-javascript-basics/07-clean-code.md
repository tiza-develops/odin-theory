1. Why is it important to write clean code?
> Because a significant amount of time is spent on reading code. This includes code written by other team members, code written by people who are no longer part of your team, and even code that you wrote two weeks ago but may not remember much about
2. What are some good principles for keeping code clean?
>  1. Revise Your Logic Before Coding
>  2. Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page
>  3. Use the Correct Indentation
>  4. Write Explanatory Comments
>  5. But don't abuse comments!
>  6. Don't write way too long functions
>  7. Use naming standards
>  8. Don't disrupt held conventions when you are making chages
>  9. Don't mix coding languages
>  10. Keep imports to a minimum
3. What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?

> | Bad comments | Good comments |
> |--------------|---------------|
> | Todo lists or notes for oneself | Explaining why this approach was chosen and why this module is necessary |
> | Blaming | Authoring |
> | Vague statements | Detailed information on what something does |
> | Explain how something works, that is already explained by the code | Quick notifications on recent changes |
> Also, don't comment out things you don't understand! Commenting out instead of deleting or asking bloats the codebase
