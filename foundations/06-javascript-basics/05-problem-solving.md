1. What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
> - Understanding the problem and plan accordingly
> - Writing pseudocode
> - Divide and conquer
2. Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
> If you don’t understand the problem, you won’t know when you’ve successfully solved it and may waste a lot of time on a wrong solution.
3. What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
> To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps. When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.
4. What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
> Ask yourself the following questions:
> - What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
> - What’s the desired output?
> - Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
5. What is an algorithm?
> A recipe to solve a particular problem
6. What is pseudocode?
> Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem.
7. What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
> If the problem is sufficiently complex, you’ll get yourself tied in knots and make life a lot harder for yourself. Decomposing problems into smaller and easier to solve subproblems is a much better approach. Decomposition is the main way to deal with complexity, making problems easier and more approachable to solve and understand.
